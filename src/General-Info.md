Angular is a component driven language.  Components are pieces of the User Interface (UI) including the template(html), logic, and styling. Components are reusable and can be embedded into the template as an XML-like tag. Angular is especially well-suited for instances when you have the followings:
• Applications with a lot of data.
• Applications in which the data is constantly changing, and
• Big complicated apps where you want to break it down into numerous components.Angular allows us to create reactive components and, in effect, transformation paths for our data.**Advantages of Angular:**
• Improves application design architecture
• Encourages the reuse of code
• Provides plug-and-play components
• Composed of simple-to-remove components
• Uses two-way data binding
• Leads to better teamwork
